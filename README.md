## Here are some important functions 
1. The user can browse through the website.

#### Home section 
2. The user can download the CV in a pdf format.
3. The user can click on the icons and the user will be directed at the location of that icon, for instance, if the user click github icon, then the user will be directed to githup page.

8.The user can browse through my images that are displayed there.
  
#### Contact form Section 
9. When user fills the form, the information will be sent to Google Sheets and I used App Scripts to connect the form to Google Sheets. 

## Challenges
To make the website responsive to smaller screens like phones and tablets is bit hard. As much as I tried, the responsive of the website will differ from devices to devices.

## Some noticable improvements that could be made
1. Make the website responsive to all devices
2. Add AI Chat bot to assist the user with the navigation of the website.
3. Add all relavant information of each project on the portfolio.
