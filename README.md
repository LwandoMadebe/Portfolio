## Challenges
To make the website responsive to smaller screens like phones and tablets is bit hard. As much as I tried, the responsive of the website will differ from devices to devices.

## Some noticable improvements that could be made
1. Make the website responsive to all devices
2. Add AI Chat bot to assist the user with the navigation of the website.
3. Add all relavant information of each project on the portfolio.
